\section{CERN and the Large Hadron Collider}

CERN (Organisation europeene pour la recherche nucleaire) is a particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland crossing the Franco-Swiss border between the Swiss commune of Meyrin and French town of Saint-Genis Pouilly. It was founded in 1952 with the creation of the Coseil Europ\'{e}en pour la Recherche Nucl\'{e}aire, which became the Organisation in 1954. It houses an accelerator complex (shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CERN-acc-complex})
