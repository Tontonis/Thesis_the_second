Thesis corrections so far

Introduction - Abstract redo. More emphasis on the fact that the MKI was a limiting factor on the integrated luminosity due to RF heating.
Transverse dynamics - notes about transverse emittane - preserved quantity
Longitudnal dynamics -  a short introduction with parallels to transverse dynamics. Simple introduction - principle of phase stability - short longitudinal emittance and diagram. 

Wakefields and Impedance(s)

be consistent with i or j
Introduction - include statement "In this derivation we follow closely the introductions given by Vaccarro and Stupakov."
bunch wake function - wakepotential
broken figure link fig. 2.5 - Resistive wall formula
Classical formula - should be Tsutsui formalism
Beam induced heating - width of equations! Reformat to meet margin requirements
Instabilities - Tune shift. Change x displacement to include linear solution and then a perturbation to this solution.
Asymmetric method - Write how to calculate the constant transverse term 

Beam-based measurement techniques
Possibly include introduction to longitudinal motion here with comments on phase slip and potential well distortion.


LHC MKI
Heating pre ts3 - Make each a full page width to show the figures. They're important.
Heating post TS3 - do similar
Relink figures 8.12/13
Table - figures heating etc.

Conclusions
Pros and cons of RF fingers and ferrite
RF heating - known for lepton machines (B-factories)
