\section{Simulations and Measurements of the MKI with 15 Screen Conductors}

To begin an analysis of the heating of the MKIs, and to verify the use of simulations as a tool for evaluating different designs of the MKI impedance reduction methods, it was important to measure an existing MKI configuration as a benchmark. Due to the expected low beam coupling impedance of the MKI even with 15 screen conductors (on the order of 100$\Omega$ longitudinal beam coupling impedance) it was decided to do the measurements using the resonant coaxial wire method, described in Sec.~\ref{sec:reson-coax-meth}. This method limits the frequency resolution of the measurements ($\Delta{} f = c/ (\Delta \lambda) = c/(2L_{device}) \approx 40MHz$ where $c$ is the speed of light and $L_{device}\approx 3.5m$ is the length of the MKI in it's vacuum tank), but the accuracy in this measurement is considered appropriate in this case.

The measurements were carried out on a fully assembled MKI inside it's vacuum tank, with a ceramic tube housing 15 tapered screen conductors. For the single wire measurements a silver coated copper wire of radius 0.5mm with 2.1$\mu$m thickness of silver was placed in the central beam pipe, suspended on a vacuum flange modified to take a Sucobox connection allowing a small capacitance, in a seperate sucobox, to be attached to the connecting box. The soft copper wire has a tensile strength of 250$N/mm^{2}$: soft wire is used as it can be readily straightened by gentle pulling. The wire is not enamelled so as to avoid contamination of the kicker magnet during soldering of the wire. To displace the wire for displaced single wire measurements, a pair of nylon screws (one at each flange) were used to physically displace the wire. Displacements were taken at 3mm intervals in both the vertical and horizontal planes, between -9mm and +9mm displacement.

For the two wire measurements, two wires were suspended in the device, separated by 7mm. The wires were connected to a single VNA, each connection run through a 180$^{\circ}$ hybrid to generate the appropriate phase difference between the two wires. The experimental setup for the two wire measurements is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mki-meas-two-wire}.

The VNA is calibrated using an 8532E calibration kit, using an IF bandwidth of 1kHz (chosen to ensure that the frequency of each data point is well defined, but not so restricted that the sweep time is excessively long). 2000 equally spaced data points are used over a frequency range of 1MHz-2GHz. The Q factors and resonant frequencies of the resonant modes are calculated using a peak finding algorithm on the VNA, and the conductive losses due to the wire calculated analytically and compensated for.

The simulations of the MKI are carried out using CST Particle Studio, a time domain simulation code. The particle beam was simulated traversing the kicker magnet and the trailing signal Fourier transformed to acquire the beam coupling impedance in the longitudinal and transverse planes. A simplified model of the magnet is created, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mki-simulation-model}. An integrated wakelength of 15m is used in the simulations, and a simulated bunch of a Gaussian profile with $\sigma_{z}=$45mm used. A half model is used for displacements of the source/integration path in the vertical axis due to the symmetry plane in the y-z plane, giving a mesh count of $\approx$ 16 million for vertically displaced simulations and $\approx$ 32 million for horizontally displaced simulations. To acquire the dipolar and constant transverse impedance terms, the source signal is displaced whilst the path of integration is kept on axis. The linear variation in the resulting impedance can be seen to be the dipolar term and the constant impedance the constant term. Similarly for the quadrupolar term the source signal is kept on axis and the integration path displaced.

It can be seen that there is generally good agreement between the measurements and simulations in all planes. In particular the agreement for the real component of the longitudinal impedance between measurements and simulations is very good below 1.5GHz (Fig.~\ref{fig:mki-15-longitudinal}). This is considered an important verification of the simulation model as this is presently the impedance of  concern with respect to beam-induced heating. Discrepencies can be seen in the longitudinal measurements above 1.5GHz - this is likely due to differences between the internal structure of the magnet and that represented by the simulation model as well as the presence of the sucoboxes in the measurements.

In the transverse plane the real component of the dipolar impedance in both the vertical and horizontal plane show reasonable agreement between the simulations and the measurements (Fig.~\ref{fig:mki-15-dipolar}) in as much that the simulated impedance predicts a small transverse impedance and the measured impedance is likewise small. Similarly the agreement for the real components of the quadrupolar impedance is good over much of the frequency range, although the simulation and measurement results begin to diverge above 1.7GHz (Fig.~\ref{fig:mki-15-quadrupolar}). The real component of the constant transverse term shows a good agreement up until $\approx$ 1GHz whereupon the results diverge (Fig.~\ref{fig:mki-15-constant}). This is due to the sentivity of these results to the systematic and random errors in the measurement of the longitudinal impedance. The comparatively small longitudinal impedance measured in this instance leads to large errors in these results. 

For reference the noise floor for the measurements is approximately 0.06dB. In terms of the longitudinal impedance this is approximately 5$\Omega$, and in the transverse plane approximately 240$\Omega$ and 0.2$\Omega$ for values of 1MHz and 1GHz respectively, to illustrate that this decreases in significance at higher frequencies. For the transverse plane this is determined by taking the longitudinal noise floor, and normalising by the wavenumber $k$ at the frequency of measurement. With uncertainties in the displacement of the wire and the additional losses generated by the addition of the sucoboxes and other electrical connections this goes someway to explaining the discrepencies between measurements and simulations. 

\subsection{Beam Induced Heating Estimates for 15 Screen Conductors}

It can clearly be seen from the measurements of the real longitudinal impedance (Fig.~\ref{fig:mki-15-longitudinal}) that there is a significant broadband impedance to the structure which would cause beam induced heating. This strongly indicates that the removal of the 9 screen conductors closest to the HV busbar has drastically decreased the screening of the ferrite yoke from the beam image current.

To provide a first estimate of the expected heating of the MKI it is neccesary to estimate the power loss in the MKI. Taking the simulation impedance (due to allowing a finer resolution of frequency) the power is estimated using the broadband method of heat calculation given in Sec.~\ref{sec:beam_induced_heating}. For these calculations we consider the operational parameters for the 2012 proton run in the LHC, summarised in Tab.~\ref{tab:mki-beam-parameters}. Estimates for power loss for longitudinal profiles of Gaussian, parabolic and cos$^{2}$ profiles assuming bunch lengths between 1.0 and 1.4ns are shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:mki-15-heating}. The thermal evolution of the MKI with this power load (assuming all the power is lost in the ferrite yoke for a worst case scenario) has been evaluated extensively by Garlasche et al \cite{Garlasche:2dHeat}, and has been found to be compatible with the measured temperature of the MKI thermal probes \cite{Barnes:mkiHeating}. In response to this the MKI interlock temperature was increased a number of times during 2011 and 2012 as analysis of the softstart data demonstrated that the ferrite was below its Curie temperature.

1.1 & 113 & 115 & 171 \\ \hline
1.2 & 98 & 99 & 143 \\ \hline

\end{table}

It has thus been shown that the power loss due to the beam induced wakefields into the MKI can describe the temperature behaviour seen during 2011 and 2012 operation, giving us confidence in our understanding of the sources of, and heating processes occuring within, the MKI. To propose workable improvements to the beam screen, it is first neccesary to understand both the sources of the impedance due to the beam screen layout and the limitations that both manufacturability and the transient electrical potential on the screen conductors produces. In addition other methods of decreasing both the power load and of improving the cooling of the ferrite yoke are complementary avenues of study to reduce the problem of beam-induced heating in the MKIs, the problem ultimately being the high temperature of the ferrite yoke.
