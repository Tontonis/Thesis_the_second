\section{Simulations and Measurements of the MKI with 19 Screen Conductors}

As can be seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:mki-ip8-heating-2011}, MKI8d had experienced significantly higher temperatures than the other kicker magnets during operation. Although estimated to experience the same degree of power loss within the structure as the other kicker magnets (due to the similarity of the beam screen layout) the large variation in the emissivity of the internal surface of the vacuum tank can have contributed to the higher temperatures observed. As a result of this, and the necessity to find a solution to the high temperatures of the MKIs, which were acting as a severe limiter on the integrated luminousity delivered by the LHC, it was decided to implement an improved beam screen in a replacement magnet in an effort to reduce the power loss in this magnet, and at the same time test some of the principles of future alternative beam screen designs.

The following design features were implemented in the replacement MKI8d (explanations are given with the description):
