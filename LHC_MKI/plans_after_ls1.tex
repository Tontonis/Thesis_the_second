\section{Upgrade Plans for Long Shutdown 1 and Beyond}

During long shutdown 1 (LS1) it has been decided to first carry out measurements of the beam impedance and electrical breakdowns observed of the proposed new beam screen design, and subsequently construct 8 new kicker magets implementing the new screen design and the additional proposed changes to the inside of the vacuum tank to reduce the temperatures reached in the ferrite yoke. Thermal simulations have indicated that the proposed screen designs will be capable of reducing the maximum temperature reached in the ferrite yoke below the curie temperature for the nominal operating conditions for the LHC, and for a number of proposed HL-LHC operating conditions also (see Fig.~\ref{fig:pow-loss-stable-temp-mkis}). In addition electric field simulations have strongly indicated that the induced electric potential on the screen conductors will not be sufficient to induce electrical breakdowns beyond an unsafe operating point.
