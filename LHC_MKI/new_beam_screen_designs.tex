\section{New Beam Screen Designs}

Using the knowledge acquired from examining the beam coupling impedance dependence on the layout of the beam screen from the previous section, and additionally the electrical field simulations of the induced voltages on the screen conductors during magnet firing and number of alternative beam screen designs have been proposed. The driving points in these designs has been to reduce the power loss into the MKI (in this case to reduce the temperatures reached by the ferrite yoke) and to reduce the induced voltage in the screen conductors during magnet firing to eliminate electrical breakdown/discharge between the screen conductors and along the end the surface of the beam screen to a ground plane.

The proposed designs are described below:

\begin{itemize}
\item{24 screen conductors of alternating length, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:24-alternating-length}}
\item{24 screen conductors tapered in length, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:24-tapered-length}}
\item{24 screen conductors some with an alternating length and then tapered towards the HV busbar, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:24-alternating-tapered}}
\item{24 screen conductors in enclosed slots in the ceramic beam screen, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:24-enclosed-slots}}
\item{An alternative screen conductor layout, in which some are conductively connected to ground on both ends and all other capacitively coupled, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:alt-screen-design}}
\item{24 screen conductors with the metallization replaced by an external metal cylinder, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:24-step-out}}
\item{24 screen conductors with part of the metallization replaced by a external metal cylinder, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:24-step-out-slight}}
\item{24 screen conductors of a mixture of alternating and tapered lengths with part of the metallization replaced with an external metal cylinder, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:24-final-design}}
\end{itemize}
