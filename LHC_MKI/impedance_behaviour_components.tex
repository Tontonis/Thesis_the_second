\section{The Dependence of the Beam Coupling Impedance on The Kicker Components}

As part of the study to improve the beam screen it was decided to investigate systematically the effect of the various commponents of the kicker magnet on the resulting beam coupling impedance. This is divided into two sections, the study of the effect of the beam screen on the beam coupling impedance of the ferrite yoke, and subsequently a study of the effects of the dimensions of the beam screen and screen conductors on the beam coupling impedance.

\subsection{The Impedance of the MKI - Effects of the Inclusion of the Beam Screen}

To first judge the effectiveness of the concept of the beam screen as an impedance reduction technique we simulate the MKI by systematically adding components to the magnet to determine their effect on the beam coupling impedance. We consider the following configurations of the MKI:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{The c-core ferrite yoke}
\item{The c-core ferrite yoke with a ceramic cylinder inserted inside}
\item{As above but with 24 screen conductors inserted into the cylinder, capactively coupled at one end}
\item{The internal magnet structure including the vacuum tank, HV and ground plates and the surrounding connections.}
\end{enumerate}

These geometries are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mki-layout-buildup}, and the resulting impedance simulations for the real component shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mki-buildup-impedance}. It can be seen

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Start with a simple c - core ferrite magnet}
\item{Add a ceramic tube}
\item{Add screen conductors in internal side - Brief interlude about the limitations this places on the magnet rise time due to creating a Faraday cage}
\item{Add the capacitive coupling - Different lengths of overlap to demonstrate that this controls the frequency of the resonances. Also lengths of the screen conductors for lower resonances}
\item{Add the ferrite damping rings - damp resonances of length of screen conductor - not(!) overlap}
\item{Hopefully show that this is the dominant cause of the resonances}
\item{Show only dependent on capacitively coupled end dimensions - Examine pipe thickness, conductor length.}
\end{enumerate}
