In this thesis has been presented a number of studies into the impedance reduction techniques employed in two key systems in LHC, the collimation systems and the injection kicker magnets. Problems with these systems have been examined, focusing on their shortcomings from an operational standpoint especially the high temperatures experienced due to beam-induced heating, using both computational and bench-top measurements to identify and charcterise the beam-coupling impedance responsible for this. As part of this a new method for measuring the transverse beam impedances of asymmetric structures has been proposed and verified using experimental and computational measurements against both an analytical model and a measured setup. In addition a study of the power loss in ferrite damped cavities with different extents of damping and screening of the ferrite has been studied in order to better understand the heat loads in structures with a complex structure which may limit the effective damping of cavity modes by ferrite.

Subsequently improvements to the existing systems have been proposed, with a certain focus on the expected power load due to beam-induced heating, resulting in a new RF damping system for use in the TCTP collimators, and possibly for further use in the phase 2 secondary collimators. In addition an improved beam screen for use in the LHC injection kicker magnets has been proposed: this will be constructed, tested for electric field surface flashover and installed during LS1 in 2013/14.

It has become clear during this work that with the increasing high beam currents demanded at high energy hadron colliders, in addition to the very long fill times, that beam-induced heating must seriously be considered as a potential limitation on the integrated luminosity delivered to the experiments due to both high temperatures that may damage equipment, or due to long cool down times necessary between uses. As such knowledge of the existing impedance reduction techniques must be propogated to the accelerator community: the importance of the study and correct implementation of appropriate beam impedance reduction techniques cannot be emphasised enough.
