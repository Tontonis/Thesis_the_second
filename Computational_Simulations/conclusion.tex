\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter we have given a basic introduction to some of the simulation tools that are available for impedance evaluation in both the time domain and frequency domain. We have discussed the advantages and disadvantage of both, and their parallels to either beam-equipment interactions or to bench-top measurement methods. These codes are subsequently used extensively in later chapters for the evaluation of beam coupling impedances of differents devices.
